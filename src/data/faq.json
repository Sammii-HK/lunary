Instead of generic sun sign horoscopes, you get daily insights based on how today's planetary movements affect YOUR unique chart.\n\nEvery insight is calculated from your specific birth time and location—when we say \"Mars enters your 10th house,\" that's based on YOUR chart, not your sun sign."

          "answer": "Not directly—Lunary is focused on YOUR personal practice.\n\n**What Lunary does:** Helps you deeply understand your own chart through daily practice and pattern recognition.\n\n**What Lunary doesn't do:**\n- No synastry (comparing two charts)\n- No composite charts\n- No ability to read for friends/clients\n\nWe believe astrology is most powerful as a personal self-awareness practice. The skills you gain reading your own chart do transfer if you want to learn chart reading later."
