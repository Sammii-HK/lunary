      "question": "What are astrology transits in {year}?",
      "answer": "Astrology transits are the real-time movements of the planets compared to your birth chart (or compared to key zodiac points). A {year} transit calendar highlights major shifts—like ingresses, retrogrades, and sign changes—so you can time planning, reflection, and action more intentionally."
    },
    "intro": "This page is a year-level map of major astrology transits. Use it to track the biggest shifts of {year}—then click into each transit for meaning, timing notes, and the signs most likely to feel it strongly.",
    "tldr": "Use this {year} transit calendar to spot big turning points (ingresses and long-range cycles), plan for review periods (retrogrades), and choose better timing for launches, conversations, and commitments. Transits are universal, but their impact becomes personal when you map them to your houses and natal placements.",

        "question": "Do I need exact birth time to use this page?",

      {
        "question": "What’s the difference between an ingress and a transit aspect?",
        "answer": "An ingress is a planet entering a new zodiac sign. A transit aspect is the angle a transiting planet forms to a natal planet or point (like a conjunction, square, or trine). Both can matter, but they answer different questions: “What’s the tone?” vs “What’s being activated?”"
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this astronomy or astrology?",
        "answer": "The planetary positions and motions are astronomical facts. The meaning and interpretation (how those positions relate to themes in life) is astrology."
