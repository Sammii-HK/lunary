# Lunary Orbit: Content Scheduling Strategy

One brand voice, adapted to each platform's gravity.

## Platform Overview

| Platform     | Purpose                            | Tone                                    | Cadence                      | Goal                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| TikTok       | Discovery + emotion                | Raw, honest, lowercase storytelling     | 3–5× week                    | Reach & trust          |
| Instagram    | Aesthetic anchor + soft conversion | Aspirational yet calm; ritual & beauty  | 3× week feed + daily stories | Nurture & conversion   |
| Twitter / X  | Thought leadership + transparency  | Sentence case, reflective, direct       | 1–2× day                     | Authority & connection |
| Pinterest    | Search + passive discovery         | Quiet visual guides, keywords in titles | 5–10 pins/week               | Long-tail growth       |
| Email / Blog | Depth & retention                  | Grounded, intimate, reflective          | 1× week                      | Conversion & loyalty   |

## Brand Tone & Messaging Core

Everything stems from your tone: **grounded spirituality, emotional truth, and modern calm.**

### Keep:

- Sentence case for all posts (capitalize first letter of sentences)
- No em dashes, ever
- Rhythm from line breaks
- Vulnerability first, value second
- No hype. Authenticity > performance

## Best Posting Times (by Platform)

| Platform          | Best Days     | Best Time (UTC) | Note                                |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| TikTok            | Mon–Thu       | 16:00–20:00     | Evenings = emotional scroll time    |
| Instagram Feed    | Tue, Thu, Sun | 15:00–19:00     | End-of-day calm mood                |
| Instagram Stories | Daily         | 10:00–22:00     | 2–3 spaced posts, behind-the-scenes |
| X / Twitter       | Mon–Fri       | 12:00–15:00     | Lunch-scroll window                 |
| Pinterest         | Sat–Sun       | 14:00–18:00     | Weekend inspiration                 |
| Email/Blog        | Wed           | 09:00           | Mid-week reflection theme           |

**Focus on consistency:** Same days/times weekly = algorithmic trust.

## Content Structure by Platform

### ✨ TikTok

**Hook:** Sentence case, emotional and authentic

**Mid:** story / lesson / truth moment

**End:** hopeful takeaway or small CTA ("comment a 🌙 if you're rebuilding")

**30–60 s max;** single angle, strong lighting

**Reuse successful post themes every 6–8 weeks** with new wording

**CTA ideas:**

- "Download Lunary for your daily alignment"
- "Get your birth chart at lunary.app — it's free"

### 🌸 Instagram

**Feed:** calm visuals + carousel text posts or reels

**Stories:** daily cosmic updates, polls, behind-the-scenes

**Highlights:** "daily insight", "moon today", "tarot", "your stories"

**Use reels for top-of-funnel discovery** (mirror your tiktoks but polish transitions)

**Static carousels for conversion:**

- Slide 1 = quote
- Slide 2 = meaning
- Slide 3 = CTA ("get yours today")

**Caption tone:** poetic → reflective → soft invite

Example: "Today's moon reminds us to begin again. Get your daily insight in the Lunary app."

### 🩵 Twitter / X

Share mini reflections, behind-the-scenes of building lunary, user lessons.

Mix truth-threads ("what building an astrology app taught me about focus") and short stand-alone posts ("the algorithm didn't kill your art. burnout did.").

Always 1 clear thought per tweet; no hashtags.

CTA occasionally ("get your cosmic rhythm at lunary.app").

**Cadence:**

- 1 daily tweet
- 1 thread weekly
- Schedule at 12:00–15:00 UTC via Typefully/Hypefury

### 🌿 Pinterest

Treat as visual blog.

Post guides: "lunar phases 2025", "tarot spreads for clarity", "morning rituals under new moon".

Each pin → link to your blog post or pack page.

Use keywords naturally in pin titles + alt text.

Maintain a consistent brand palette (#1a1a2e backgrounds, muted purples, serif or mono font).

### 🗓️ Email / Blog

**Weekly "cosmic digest":**

Theme: this week's sky + 1 life reflection

Short horoscope preview + CTA "read the full insight in Lunary"

Sign-off tone: gentle gratitude

**Structure:**

1. Greeting
2. Reflection / story (emotional anchor)
3. Insight / value
4. App link
5. Thank you line ("thank you for being part of the cosmos with me.")

## Content Repurposing System

**Write once → use everywhere.**

e.g., a TikTok script becomes:

- An Instagram reel (same video)
- A carousel quote
- A tweet thread
- A short blog intro

Centralize in Notion calendar (same one you're already using for CMS).

Columns: idea → draft → scheduled → live.

Tag each post with platforms & theme (moon / tarot / astrology / personal).

Set Vercel cron to auto-generate daily content for stories or posts (already working).

| Sun | Rest / ambient post | Moon phase post | Gratitude tweet    | 1–2 pins            | —          |

## Growth Accelerators

**Collabs:** Guest posts with other astrology/tarot creators (shared audience = authenticity).

**UGC incentives:** Feature user charts ("your cosmic insight of the week").

**Email–social loop:** Embed top tiktoks or reels inside your weekly email.

**Seasonal spikes:** New moons, mercury retrograde, eclipses = post twice as often.

**Reels + tiktoks boost:** Small paid budget ($10–20 per reel) to your app download link at these spikes.
