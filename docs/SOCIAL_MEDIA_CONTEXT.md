## Content Philosophy: 80/20 Rule

**80% of posts should be pure value content (no CTA):**

- Educational insights about astrology/astronomy
- Cosmic wisdom and guidance
- Behind-the-scenes founder journey
- Interesting facts and "did you know" content

**20% of posts can include soft CTAs:**

- "discover at lunary.app"
- "try Lunary"
- For promotional posts during beta: mention code STARGAZER for 12 months free
- Outside of dedicated promo posts, avoid pricing/trial mentions

## Content Archetypes (Rotate Between These)

1. **Founder/Indie Dev Journey** - Vulnerable, behind-the-scenes content about building Lunary. Share real challenges, learnings, and discoveries. Use "I" statements. No selling.

2. **Educational** - Teach ONE concept clearly. "Did you know" style hooks. Astronomy facts, how features actually work. Make complex topics approachable.

3. **Cosmic Insight** - Value-first cosmic wisdom. Share insights that stand alone without mentioning the app. Be poetic but grounded.

4. **Feature Deep-Dive** - Explain ONE specific unique feature in depth. Focus on AI memory, tarot patterns, personal transits, or the grimoire. Show WHY it matters.

5. **User Transformation** - What people actually experience. Focus on feelings and outcomes, not features. Paint a picture of understanding yourself better.

## Social Media Best Practices

- Lead with curiosity, vulnerability, or education - NOT features
- Use emojis sparingly (🌙 ✨ 🔮) - max 1-2 per post
- Each post should feel unique - different hooks, angles, structures
- Sound human - never salesy or generic
- Focus on value and authenticity over conversion
- Use storytelling when possible
- Show, don't just tell

## Educational Content Guidelines

- Share insights from grimoire content (e.g., "Understanding moon phases and their meanings", "How crystals work with chakras")
- Educational posts about personal transits, tarot patterns, grimoire topics
- Focus on evergreen educational content about features and concepts
- Avoid time-sensitive content like sabbats/seasonal celebrations
- Examples of educational topics:
  - "What are tarot patterns and how do they reveal recurring themes?"

  - "The difference between daily, weekly, and personal tarot cards"
  - "How birth chart houses show which areas of life are activated"

## Example Posts by Archetype

**Founder/Indie Dev Journey (no CTA):**

- "Building an astrology app taught me that most 'horoscopes' are just recycled generic text. I spent 6 months learning real astronomy so Lunary could calculate actual planetary positions. The difference is everything."
- "I used to think astrology was just sun signs. Then I learned about houses, aspects, transits. Your birth chart is a complete map of the sky the moment you were born. That's what I wanted Lunary to show people."
- "The hardest part of building Lunary was realizing accuracy matters more than features. I deleted 3 months of work to rebuild the astronomical calculations from scratch."
- "Why I built an AI that remembers your conversations: astrology isn't one-size-fits-all. Your chart is unique. Your questions deserve context."

**Educational (no CTA):**

- "Your birth chart has 12 houses. Each one represents a different area of life - career, relationships, home, creativity. When planets move through these houses, they activate different themes for YOU specifically."
- "The difference between your sun sign and rising sign: your sun is your core identity. Your rising is how others perceive you. They're often completely different signs."
- "Mercury retrograde isn't actually moving backwards. It's an optical illusion from Earth's perspective. But the energy shift during these periods? That's real astronomical geometry at work."
- "Your moon sign shapes your emotional world. It's calculated from the moon's exact position when you were born. Most people don't know theirs - but it explains so much about how you process feelings."

**Cosmic Insight (no CTA):**

- "The moon doesn't create your emotions. It illuminates what's already there. Full moons bring things to light. New moons invite you to plant seeds in the dark."
- "Every planet in your chart tells a story. Mars is how you take action. Venus is how you connect. Saturn is where you face resistance. The whole sky was arranged uniquely for you."
- "Retrograde periods aren't punishment. They're invitations to revisit, review, and reconsider. The universe doesn't move against you - it moves with purpose."
- "Transits don't happen TO you. They happen WITH you. The planets are always moving, always activating different parts of your chart. It's a conversation, not a verdict."

**Feature Deep-Dive (soft CTA):**

- "Most AI chatbots forget you exist between sessions. The Astral Guide remembers your birth chart, your past questions, your recurring themes. Ask about your career today, and it knows you asked about Saturn transits last week."
- "Tarot apps show you a card. Lunary shows you patterns. Which cards keep appearing? What themes are recurring? Over 30 days, the patterns tell a story single readings can't."
- "Generic transit forecasts say 'Mars is in Aries.' Personal transits say 'Mars is activating your 7th house - relationships and partnerships are energized.' The difference is YOUR birth chart."
- "Your Book of Shadows isn't just a journal. It tracks patterns across entries - recurring moods, card references, moon phases. Over time, you see your own cosmic story emerge."
- "Moon Circles guide you through new moon intentions and full moon releases. Each lunation has a theme, focus points, and community insights."

**Beta Launch Promo (use sparingly):**

- "We're in beta and inviting early adopters to join. Use code STARGAZER for 12 months of Lunary+ free. Real astronomical data, personalized insights, an AI that remembers your journey."
- "Building Lunary has been a two-year journey. For our beta launch, we're giving early adopters 12 months free with code STARGAZER. Come grow with us."

**Discord Community (encourage joining):**

- "We're building a community of stargazers. Join us on Discord for daily cosmic insights, beta access, and real conversations about what the stars reveal. discord.gg/yatwZTf7"
- "The best part of building Lunary? The community. Join our Discord - we share daily cosmic weather, discuss transits, and genuinely want to hear what features you'd love. discord.gg/yatwZTf7"
- "Want to shape the future of Lunary? Join our Discord. Beta testers get early access to new features and direct input on what we build next. discord.gg/yatwZTf7"

**User Transformation (soft CTA):**

- "Understanding your birth chart doesn't predict your future. It explains your patterns. Why you always react that way. Why certain relationships feel harder. Why some things come naturally. That self-knowledge is the transformation."
- "Imagine knowing exactly when your energy will be high for starting projects vs. when to rest and reflect. Personal transits give you that - a cosmic calendar aligned to YOUR chart."
- "You've probably read your sun sign horoscope and thought 'this doesn't feel like me.' That's because you're reading 1/12th of your chart. Your full chart has your moon, rising, and 8 other planets. It's a complete picture."
