## Content Philosophy: 80/20 Rule

**20% of posts can include soft CTAs:**

- "discover at lunary.app"
- "try Lunary"
- Never mention pricing, trials, or "free"

## Content Archetypes (Rotate Between These)

1. **Founder/Indie Dev Journey** - Vulnerable, behind-the-scenes content about building Lunary. Share real challenges, learnings, and discoveries. Use "I" statements. No selling.

2. **Educational** - Teach ONE concept clearly. "Did you know" style hooks. Astronomy facts, how features actually work. Make complex topics approachable.

3. **Cosmic Insight** - Value-first cosmic wisdom. Share insights that stand alone without mentioning the app. Be poetic but grounded.

4. **Feature Deep-Dive** - Explain ONE specific unique feature in depth. Focus on AI memory, tarot patterns, personal transits, or the grimoire. Show WHY it matters.

5. **User Transformation** - What people actually experience. Focus on feelings and outcomes, not features. Paint a picture of understanding yourself better.

## Social Media Best Practices

## Example Posts by Archetype

**Founder/Indie Dev Journey (no CTA):**

- "Building an astrology app taught me that most 'horoscopes' are just recycled generic text. I spent 6 months learning real astronomy so Lunary could calculate actual planetary positions. The difference is everything."
- "I used to think astrology was just sun signs. Then I learned about houses, aspects, transits. Your birth chart is a complete map of the sky the moment you were born. That's what I wanted Lunary to show people."
- "The hardest part of building Lunary was realizing accuracy matters more than features. I deleted 3 months of work to rebuild the astronomical calculations from scratch."
- "Why I built an AI that remembers your conversations: astrology isn't one-size-fits-all. Your chart is unique. Your questions deserve context."

**Educational (no CTA):**

- "Your birth chart has 12 houses. Each one represents a different area of life - career, relationships, home, creativity. When planets move through these houses, they activate different themes for YOU specifically."
- "The difference between your sun sign and rising sign: your sun is your core identity. Your rising is how others perceive you. They're often completely different signs."
- "Mercury retrograde isn't actually moving backwards. It's an optical illusion from Earth's perspective. But the energy shift during these periods? That's real astronomical geometry at work."
- "Your moon sign shapes your emotional world. It's calculated from the moon's exact position when you were born. Most people don't know theirs - but it explains so much about how you process feelings."

**Cosmic Insight (no CTA):**

- "The moon doesn't create your emotions. It illuminates what's already there. Full moons bring things to light. New moons invite you to plant seeds in the dark."
- "Every planet in your chart tells a story. Mars is how you take action. Venus is how you connect. Saturn is where you face resistance. The whole sky was arranged uniquely for you."
- "Retrograde periods aren't punishment. They're invitations to revisit, review, and reconsider. The universe doesn't move against you - it moves with purpose."
- "Transits don't happen TO you. They happen WITH you. The planets are always moving, always activating different parts of your chart. It's a conversation, not a verdict."

**Feature Deep-Dive (soft CTA):**

- "Most AI chatbots forget you exist between sessions. Lunary's AI remembers your birth chart, your past questions, your recurring themes. Ask about your career today, and it knows you asked about Saturn transits last week."
- "Tarot apps show you a card. Lunary shows you patterns. Which cards keep appearing? What themes are recurring? Over 30 days, the patterns tell a story single readings can't."
- "Generic transit forecasts say 'Mars is in Aries.' Personal transits say 'Mars is activating your 7th house - relationships and partnerships are energized.' The difference is YOUR birth chart."

**User Transformation (soft CTA):**

- "Understanding your birth chart doesn't predict your future. It explains your patterns. Why you always react that way. Why certain relationships feel harder. Why some things come naturally. That self-knowledge is the transformation."
- "Imagine knowing exactly when your energy will be high for starting projects vs. when to rest and reflect. Personal transits give you that - a cosmic calendar aligned to YOUR chart."
- "You've probably read your sun sign horoscope and thought 'this doesn't feel like me.' That's because you're reading 1/12th of your chart. Your full chart has your moon, rising, and 8 other planets. It's a complete picture."
