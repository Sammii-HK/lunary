# Platform Optimization Research (Feb 2026)

Research into optimising content for each social platform individually. Findings used to inform the caption generation pipeline.

---

## TikTok

### Caption Sweet Spot

- **150-300 characters** for most content (algorithm sweet spot)
- Up to 2,200 chars for storytelling/educational, but front-load value
- Primary keyword in first 150 characters — TikTok indexes early text more heavily
- 4,000 char limit available but shorter performs better

### TikTok as a Search Engine

- 64% of Gen Z use TikTok as a search engine
- Algorithm scans 4 text layers: captions, on-screen text, spoken words, hashtags
- Use exact phrases people search: "what does mercury retrograde mean for Scorpio" not "check this out"
- Long-tail keywords > broad terms ("full moon ritual for letting go" not just "full moon")
- Keywords in captions boost visibility by 20-40%

### Algorithm Signals (ranked)

1. **Watch time / completion rate** (~40-50% weight) — 70%+ completion threshold for viral push
2. **Shares** — weighted 3x higher than likes
3. **Saves** — signals content utility
4. **Comment quality** — length and substance over raw count
5. **Likes** — weakest signal

### Hashtags

- **3-5 per post** (confirmed by ByteDance's own CapCut)
- Mix: 1 broad (#astrology) + 1-2 mid-tier niche (#mercuryretrograde) + 1-2 long-tail (#tarotforbeginner)
- Never use #fyp, #foryou, #viral — these are noise
- Hashtags are now categorisation/SEO tools, not growth hacks

### Hook (First 3 Seconds)

- Text overlays: 5-7 words max in opening frame, bold, high-contrast
- No logos/intros/branding in first 3 seconds
- Best formulas: contradiction/hot take, identity filter ("stop scrolling if you're a Scorpio"), curiosity gap, challenge belief, question hook
- Questions in captions increase comment rates by 44%

### Video Format

- **15-30 seconds** general sweet spot (highest completion rates)
- 11-18 seconds for trend-riding, 45-60 for in-depth educational
- 9:16 vertical mandatory
- Post 7-9 AM or 7-11 PM local time (22-38% more views)

### CTAs That Work

- Save-driving: "Save this for your next full moon" / "Bookmark before mercury retrograde hits"
- Share-driving: "Send this to the Scorpio in your life"
- Comment-driving: "Drop your big 3 in the comments"
- One CTA per video. Place in last 3-5 seconds spoken, or end of caption

### What Kills Reach

- Cross-platform watermarks (shadowban)
- Duplicate/recycled content (90%+ detection accuracy, penalties up to account bans)
- Deleting and reposting (interpreted as manipulation)
- Excessive hashtags (>5 sends mixed signals)
- Generic intros ("Hey guys, welcome back")
- Ignoring comments

---

## Instagram Reels

### Caption Sweet Spot

- **First 55-125 characters visible** in feed preview — this is everything
- Short captions (<150 chars) have highest engagement rate for Reels
- Use 60% short captions, 40% longer (for educational content)
- Instagram shifted from hashtag-based to keyword-based SEO — captions now indexed by Google and Bing

### Algorithm Signals (ranked)

1. **Watch time** — single most important signal (relative % and absolute seconds)
2. **DM shares** — 3-5x more valuable than likes for discovery distribution
3. **Saves** — 3x more weight than a like
4. **Comments** — especially within first hour
5. **Replays** — indicate high-value content
6. **3-second hold rate** — above 60% = 5-10x more reach than below 40%
7. **Original content** — 40-60% more distribution than reposts

### Reels vs Feed Distribution

- Reels get shown to non-followers far more aggressively (primary growth engine)
- Feed posts/carousels are engagement engines for existing followers
- Reels under 90 seconds eligible for non-follower discovery; over 90 seconds only shown to followers
- Carousels get 4x engagement but Reels get 2x reach

### Hook (First 1.7 Seconds)

- Users decide stay-or-scroll in ~1.7 seconds
- 50% drop off in first 3 seconds
- Best triggers: curiosity gap, controversy/contrarian, social proof, FOMO/urgency, immediate value
- Bold text overlay in first frame (80%+ scroll without sound)

### Video Format

- **7-30 seconds** for growth, **30-90 seconds** for educational engagement
- Keep discovery-focused Reels under 90 seconds
- 9:16 (1080x1920), no third-party watermarks
- Post 3-5 Reels/week + 1-2 carousels
- Best times: weekdays 9-12 AM, 6-7 PM; weekends 11 AM-2 PM

### Hashtags

- **3-5 max** (Instagram now limits to 5 per post)
- 80% niche + 20% trending
- Keywords in captions matter more than hashtags now
- Alt text descriptions help content classification

### Caption Structure (3-Part Formula)

1. **Line 1: Hook** (<125 chars) — stops scroll, contains primary keyword
2. **Lines 2-3: Value/Context** — insight, tip, story. Line breaks between sentences
3. **Line 4: CTA** — specific action ("Save this for March 14th" / "Send to your Aries bestie")

### CTAs That Work

- Share-focused: "Send this to your [sign] friend" (#1 — DM shares are top discovery signal)
- Save-focused: "Save this for the full moon on March 14th" (40-60% more saves with explicit CTA)
- Keyword-triggered: "Comment GUIDE and I'll DM it to you"
- Posts with clear CTAs generate 70% more comments

### What Kills Reach

- Weak/delayed hooks (lose 50% viewers immediately)
- Over-polished ad-like content (raw > perfect)
- More than 5 hashtags
- Ignoring comments in first hour
- Third-party watermarks
- Editing after posting (resets engagement signals)
- Reposting others' content excessively (10+ in 30 days = excluded from recommendations)

## Threads

### Format & Length

- 500 char limit
- **100-250 characters sweet spot** — short, punchy, conversational
- Think "fortune cookie meets hot take"
- Conversational, first-person, authentic tone

### Algorithm Signals (ranked)

1. **Replies/conversations** — #1 signal by far. 50 replies beats 200 likes with 2 replies
2. **Saves** — underrated signal for lasting value
3. **Shares/reposts** — quote posts > direct reposts (generate additional conversation)
4. **Dwell time** — pausing to read counts
5. **Profile visits** — tapping through to profile is a strong signal

### What Threads Deprioritises

- External links (50-70% reach reduction)
- Ad-like/promotional content
- Engagement bait without genuine replies
- Reposts without commentary

### Content Types That Work (ranked)

1. Hot takes / bold opinions
2. Open-ended questions ("What's your big 3 and your biggest red flag?")
3. Relatable observations
4. Fill-in-the-blank / Mad Libs formats
5. Image/carousel posts (stand out in text-heavy feed)
6. Multi-post threads for deeper educational content
7. Timely/newsjacking (tie current events to astrology)

### Key Differences from Twitter

- Much longer content lifespan (24-72 hours vs 30-60 minutes)
- Favours "warm" virality — relatable/thought-provoking over controversy
- Smaller accounts break through more easily
- Reply virality is real — replies to popular posts can go viral themselves

### Posting Cadence

- 3-7 posts/day, spaced 2-3 hours apart
- Horoscope content in mornings, hot takes in evenings
- Reply to every comment within first hour
- One tag (hashtag) per post maximum

### What Kills Reach

- External links in posts
- Cross-posting identical Twitter content
- Excessive hashtags in text (only 1 tag allowed)
- Post and ghost (not replying to comments)
- Overly negative/combative content
- Editing posts after publishing

---

## Facebook

### Facebook Reels vs Instagram Reels

- Older demographic (30-65+) — more depth, less Gen-Z humour
- Native Facebook Reels outperform cross-posted by 30-50%
- 80%+ watch without sound — text overlays/captions essential
- Longer Reels perform better (30-90 seconds vs Instagram's 7-15 second sweet spot)
- Shares (especially to Messenger/Groups) are the most powerful signal

### Algorithm Signals (ranked)

1. **Meaningful social interactions** — comment conversations weighted most heavily
2. **Shares (public + Messenger)** — "dark social" DM shares tracked and heavily weighted
3. **Dwell time** — long captions, carousels, video benefit
4. **Video watch time + completion** — 75%+ is a strong positive signal
5. **Saves/bookmarks**

### Content Formats (by organic reach)

1. Short-form video / Reels (2-3x reach of static posts)
2. Native video (1-3 minute educational)
3. Photo posts with compelling captions
4. Text-only posts (questions, hot takes)
5. Link posts (worst reach — put links in first comment instead)

### Key Differences

- Page organic reach: only 2-6% of followers (video/Reels can hit 10-20%+)
- Group posts reach 30-60% of members
- Long-form storytelling captions work (300-500 words if hook is strong)
- Hashtags minimally impactful — 3-5 max at end of post, keywords in text matter more

### Posting Strategy

- 1-2x/day on Page, 1x/day in Group
- Educational content and forecasts on Page (optimised for shares)
- Discussion questions and community content in Group (optimised for comments)

### What Kills Reach

- Link posts as primary content
- Engagement bait ("Like if you agree!")
- TikTok/Instagram watermarks
- Posting only promotional content
- Stock photos / generic AI images
- Neglecting Groups after creating them

## Top-of-Funnel: Driving App Downloads from Social Content

### The Core Tension

Most platforms penalise overt promotion. But the data shows organic reach decline happens regardless of CTAs — the real killers are poor completion rates and content that _feels_ like an ad. CTAs embedded naturally into genuinely valuable content don't hurt reach.

### The 70/20/10 Content Mix

| Type                           | % of Posts | App Mention?                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pure value / entertainment** | 70%        | No direct mention. App may appear as a tool/prop             |
| **Soft conversion**            | 20%        | Casual: "I pulled this on Lunary" / pinned comment with link |
| **Hard conversion**            | 10%        | Explicit: "Download Lunary — link in bio" / feature showcase |

### The Curiosity Gap Approach

Give 80% of the insight in the content. The app is the place to get the **personalised** version. The content must stand alone as valuable — the app is positioned as "next level", not a paywall.

**Templates:**

- **General-to-personal bridge**: Full zodiac breakdown → "But which house this falls in for YOUR chart changes everything. Lunary shows you."
- **Incomplete chart**: Partial reading → "Your Rising sign changes all of this. Get your full chart on Lunary."
- **Teased timing**: Transit explained → "Lunary tells you exactly when it hits based on your birth time."
- **Interactive qualification**: "What's your Big 3? If you don't know, Lunary calculates it in 30 seconds."

### Platform-Specific Conversion Tactics

**TikTok:**

- Mention app in first 3-5 seconds (when retention is highest, per Starcrossed method)
- Pin a comment with CTA (keeps caption clean for algorithm)
- Use app as a prop: screen record while explaining a concept
- ManyChat DM automation: "Comment CHART and I'll DM you the link"

**Instagram:**

- ManyChat keyword automation in comments → auto-DM with app link (boosts engagement AND converts)
- Story with link sticker immediately after a strong Reel
- Carousel slide 10 = CTA after 9 slides of value
- "Comment READING and I'll send you your chart" triggers

**Threads:**

- No direct links (kills reach 50-70%). Build authority first, convert through profile bio
- Persona posts with promo code work because they're conversational, not ad-like
- Cross-pollinate to Instagram where the bio link converts

**Facebook:**

- Groups as conversion engine (30-60% of members see posts vs 2-6% for Pages)
- Messenger automation via ManyChat
- Links in first comment, not in post body

### Soft CTA Techniques (for the 20%)

- **The prop mention**: Film using the app — "Let me pull up the chart..."
- **The source credit**: "According to your Lunary chart..."
- **The pinned comment**: Video has no CTA; pinned comment says link in bio
- **The story follow-up**: Reel with no CTA → Story saying "everyone's asking — it's the Lunary app"
- **The community reference**: "Join 50K people who check their Lunary chart every morning"

### Competitor Tactics Worth Stealing

- **Co-Star**: Push notifications became memes — people screenshot and share them as UGC. Distinctive weird brand voice makes content inherently shareable
- **Starcrossed**: Solo creator, 160M TikTok views in 18 months, $70K MRR in 90 days. Same video format daily, app mentioned at start of every video
- **The Pattern**: Social features inside the app create organic sharing loops — users share their results

### Benchmarks

- From 100K views → 500-2,000 profile visits (0.5-2%)
- From profile visits → 10-20% click bio link (optimised bio)
- From bio link clicks → 15-30% install
- **Net: ~0.1-0.5% of video viewers install the app**
- One viral video (1M+ views) = 1,000-5,000 installs
- Consistent daily posting compounds these numbers significantly
